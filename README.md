# Wellness Center Usage Analysis

One of my tasks while working as a Wellness Outreach Worker was to analyze our schoolâ€™s wellness center usage. My task was to calculate the total number of students using the wellness center per day, per week, per month, and the total for the semester. I was also asked to break down check-ins by grade level, ethnicity of the student, and reason for visiting the wellness center. 

* Used this analysis to plan future mental health events for students (ex. planning de-stress activities before and during finals week due to an increase in student usage of the wellness center during those weeks)
* Shared analysis with PTSA officers and school administrators to advocate for increased financial support, increased therapeutic staff hiring, and clearance to create proposed mental health events
